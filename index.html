          <strong> Tarts </strong>
          <p>
            Tarts are very similar to pies but have a few distinct differences.
            For example, they’re often made in individual portions, and the
            pastry is slightly different. Pie pastry is typically flaky, whereas
            tart pastry is thicker and will hold its shape when you pick it up.
            Furthermore, pie fillings are generally kind of sloppy. In contrast,
            tart fillings are often set and able to slice – like chocolate
            ganache.

          <strong> Ice Cream </strong>
          <p>
            Ice cream is possibly America’s favorite dessert. It’s sweet,
            creamy, and delicioulsy cold.

        <strong>Mousse</strong>
        <p>
          Mousse is a soft and fluffy dessert that has four main parts to the
          recipe: a base, a sweetener, an aerator, and a thickener. Mousse can
          range from light and airy to thick and rich. But it’s always
          scrumptious. The most common type is chocolate mousse, which can be
          served on its own or with a dollop of whipped cream. You can also add
          it to layered cakes and pastries or layer it with other mousse
          flavors. I like this white chocolate recipe!
